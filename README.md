📈 Linear Regression Project
This repository presents an implementation of both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models using Python's Scikit-learn library. The objective is to understand the fundamentals of linear regression, evaluate model performance, and visualize the results.

📚 Overview
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. This project demonstrates:

Implementing Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models.
Evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R².
Visualizing regression lines and residuals.
Interpreting model coefficients.
